## Goal of Exhibit 

The goal of the exhibit is to create interactive, engaging, and educational experiences tailored to Kindergarten through 12th-grade students. Using interactive features, the exhibit aims to foster curiosity and active exploration by encouraging students to engage directly with scientific, cultural, or artistic concepts. By incorporating age-appropriate, hands-on activities, the exhibit seeks to make learning enjoyable and memorable while addressing key educational objectives such as understanding cause-and-effect relationships, correcting misconceptions, and sparking interest in the subject matter. The primary focus is on ensuring that students can interact with the exhibit in meaningful ways, promoting discovery and conceptual understanding through well-designed, intuitive, and durable interactive elements.



## Who is our Audience?

The audience for the exhibit is Kindergarten through 12th-grade students, representing a wide range of developmental stages, interests, and learning styles. The exhibit is designed to cater to this diverse group by providing engaging, hands-on activities that are accessible and educational for younger children while still challenging and thought-provoking for older students. It considers the physical, cognitive, and social needs of the audience, ensuring the content is age-appropriate, visually appealing, and interactive. Additionally, the design emphasizes inclusivity, accommodating students with varying abilities and encouraging group interactions to reflect the collaborative nature of learning at this age.

## Concept Sketch
import pdf file here 

Our museum display that will highlight a STEM related topic will be a mock weather station. The main idea is to show how different environmental influences can affect weather data. We will create a see through box that will hold the environment where data is to be collected. We will have a door on one side to allow access to the environment. The sensors will be in the environment to collect data and transfer that information to an led screen for the museum user to access. This LED screen will also have access to a controller to adjust the environmental influence. Using this idea our team will be able to create an inclusive museum project with enough functionality to split between our team members. 

To ensure our project is inclusive we have multiple ideas we would like to implement to make our project easy to use. Some of these ideas are to have interchangeable environmental influences, speakers on LED devices, and simple controls. With our influences part of the excitement is experiencing the different types of weather. For example seeing a fog machine fill the environment and seeing the humidity and pressure change or feeling a heat lamp warm the environment and analyzing the data change. Having them be interchangeable will allow a wider range of people to fully experience our display. For example individuals with a vision impairment might not be able to see the fog machine but can feel the heat from a heat lamp. Another idea we had was to add speakers to the LED screen to allow for data to be read instead of having someone read it. This would have to be a very basic function as we are not sure how to implement this yet. Our last idea is to have easy to use controls for the user to access. These controls would only affect the environmental influence as the LED screen will have a set display shown. Our display will contain a basic written overview of the display. This overview will have background information for the display such as introductory weather information and how to use the display and access the data given.

With all the functions of this display we will be able to split our project into four parts: the Sensor, actuator, Human Machine Interface(HMI), and Wifi connection. Our sensor will read the information of the environment and send that information to both our LED screen and controller. This Section will be led by Tyler. Our actuator will be in control of the environmental influences by turning them on or off. This Section will be led by Dan. The HMI system will be an LED screen with a few buttons attached to it. The screen will display the weather data and the buttons will control a few preset modes of the environmental influence. This section will be led by Jahmel. Our final system will be the bidirectional internet communication. This will be a LED screen with a few buttons attached to it. The screen will display the weather data and the buttons will control a few preset modes of the environmental influence. This section will be led by Cade.
