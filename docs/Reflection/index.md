- Recommendations for future students: Create a numbered list with the top five recommendations for future students of what they should learn or do to prepare themselves for taking this class. Each item must be at least one complete sentence long.
- Version 2.0: If you were to create a "Version 2.0" of your communication architecture, discuss what could be improved and why it should be improved. Use the included diagrams to support the discussion. What new functions would be necessary? How would you divide up your code? How would you improve its debuggability? What peripherals or system features would you like to use or set up to make your system more reliable, stable, functional, or robust? How would you simplify, improve, or update your protocol design to support this in software? (1/2 page minimum)
