Welcome to the official project page for **Team 303**, where we are developing an interactive, web-enabled **Cooling System**. Our goal is to create an engaging STEM-based display that provides real-time environmental data while demonstrating key principles of **embedded systems, automation, and human-machine interaction**.

Our design is structured into four core subsystems, each led by a team member:

- **Communication (Cade Clonts)** – Manages web communication using an ESP32.
- **Sensor (Dotterboard)** – Collects environmental data using own microcontroller.
- **Actuator (Daniel Resnick)** – Controls mechanical responses based on system inputs.
- **Human-Machine Interface (Jahmel Garduno)** – Ensures intuitive user interaction.

We utilize **UART communication** between microcontrollers and **SPI/I2C protocols** for sensor-actuator coordination. By integrating modular design principles, we aim to develop a system that is both functional and scalable.

Through this project, we strive to **inspire curiosity in STEM** by showcasing real-world applications of embedded systems and interactive technology. Stay tuned as we document our progress, challenges, and insights throughout the semester!
