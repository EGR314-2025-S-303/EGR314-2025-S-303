## **Team Charter Report**  
Our team will work together to create a **STEM-related interactive display**. That display will be in the form of a **web-enabled physical device**. We will split our design into **four subsystems** â€” one for each team member to head. We will have one **actuator**, one **sensor**, one **controller**, and one **HMI (human machine interface)** subsystem. To complete this project the team will have **meetings (dates and times to be determined) at least once a week**. The team will **finalize project decisions** and **familiarize each other with everyone's own subsystem**. **Decisions will be decided by a majority rule voting**. In between meetings and classes our team will **communicate through Discord**. **Further roles and responsibilities will be discussed after our first meeting**. 

## **Mission Statement**  
Our mission is to **inspire curiosity and excitement for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math)** through the development of **innovative, interactive projects based on standards and modularity**. This semester, we aim to **design and construct a line-following robot**, an **engaging, web-enabled physical device** that demonstrates the principles of **automation, programming, and engineering**. 

## **Summary of Teams Decision making**  
By tailoring this project for **Kindergarten through 12th-grade audiences**, we decided we wanted to provide **hands-on learning experiences** that make **complex scientific and engineering concepts accessible and relatable**, through **interactive demonstrations**. Based on the criteria that students will explore critical STEM principles such as:

- **Problem-solving**: Understanding how **sensors, coding, and mechanical design** work together to solve a task.
- **Technology integration**: Gaining insights into how **web-enabled systems** can enhance physical devices.
- **Practical application**: Connecting STEM learning to **real-world engineering and automation challenges**.

This project not only **fosters creativity and critical thinking** but also highlights the **importance of STEM in driving innovation** and **preparing students for a tech-driven future**. By **engaging young minds**, we aim to **cultivate the next generation of innovators and problem-solvers** equipped to shape the world.
